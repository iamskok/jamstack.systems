<Notes>
  <p>
    The freedom to do good work—to design 
    the exact experiences we want for our 
    users is regularly compromised by 
    complex monolithic applications. You probably
    already heard about BIG 5. So here it is ))
    The architectures imposed by monolithic
    applications can undermine our ability to
    utilize the latest technologies and even 
    affect such things as our development
    workflows.
