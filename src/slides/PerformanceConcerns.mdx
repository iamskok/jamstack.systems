<h1>
  Monolithic apps need to generate and deliver HTML every time
  a new visitor arrives on the site
</h1>

<Split>
  <HTMLGeneration />
</Split>

<Notes>
  This alone significantly slows down page load time, but performance
  isn’t dictated by speed alone. Because monolithic apps are so large,
  it can be difficult to define architectural boundaries. The code is
  so interconnected that fixing a 🐛, updating a library, or changing
  a framework in one part of the app can break another part of it.
  Caching is another part of overall site performance. It’s possible
  that the same URL can return different content depending on a
  variety of parameters, including whether a user is logged in or the
  site was previously running a split test.
