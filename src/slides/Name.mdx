  <h2>
    The JAMstack is a name to a set of widely used architectural practices.
    It gives us one word to communicate a large range of architectural decisions.

<Notes>
  1. An entire community grew up around the first mature generation of
  static site generators like Jekyll, Middleman, Metalsmith, Cactus, 
  and Roots. 2. The tools brought back a feeling of simplicity and 
  control from the complex database-based CMSs that they replaced.
  3. At the same time, single-page app frameworks like Vue and React
  started a process of decoupling the frontend from the backend, 
  introducing build tools like Grunt, Gulp, Webpack and Babel.
  4. This brought a proper software architecture to the frontend
  workflow and empowered frontend developers to iterate much faster
  on the UI and interaction layer. 5. When these approaches to 
  building websites and applications intersected, a new API
  ecosystem began to emerge. Tools like Stripe, Disqus, and Algolia 
  made payments, comments, and search available directly from the 
  frontend via API-driven services.
